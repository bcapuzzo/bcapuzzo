Hi, my name is Brendan Capuzzo and I am a Senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying Computer & Systems Engineering and Computer Science with an expected graduation of December 2023. I am a driven and highly motivated student with an interest in emerging technologies, computer networking, and software. I am pursuing a master's degree to further refine my technical expertise and contribute to innovations across the technology industry. I possess strong programming skills and a collaborative mindset, so I am committed to making a positive impact in the field of computer science and I am actively seeking opportunities to learn and grow in a dynamic and innovative environment. I have proven success in multiple software engineering internships through collaboration, coding projects, and organizational skills.
